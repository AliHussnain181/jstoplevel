// Introduction
// JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) and Browser Object Model (BOM) to manipulate web pages.

// Everything Is an Object
// In JavaScript, everything is an object, and the DOM represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects.

// Building Our Own Simple Page
// You can create a simple HTML page and manipulate its content using JavaScript.

// DOM Hierarchy
// The DOM organizes elements in a hierarchy, with the document itself at the top.

// DOM Hierarchy Conclusion
// Understanding the hierarchy is crucial for navigating and manipulating the DOM effectively.

// What Is the BOM?
// The Browser Object Model (BOM) represents the browser itself and provides objects like window for browser-related interactions.

// DOM Versus JavaScript Versus Python
// Clarifying the differences between the DOM, JavaScript, and other programming languages.

// The DOM Is not the Same as Your HTML
// The DOM represents the document structure in memory, not the static HTML source.

// The DOM Is not What You See in the Browser
// The rendered page is the result of applying styles to the DOM, not the raw HTML.

// The DOM Is not What You See in DevTools
// DevTools show a representation of the live DOM, not the original source.

// Pseudo Elements
// Pseudo-elements like ::before and ::after are used to style specific parts of elements.

// Summary: What Is the DOM?
// The DOM is a programming interface for web documents, providing a structured representation that JavaScript can interact with.

// What Can We Do with the DOM?
// JavaScript can dynamically modify the content, structure, and style of a web page by interacting with the DOM.

// Quick Example of Changing the DOM
// Below is a simple example of changing the content of an HTML element using JavaScript.

// Get the element with id "exampleElement"
var exampleElement = document.getElementById("exampleElement");

// Change its inner text
exampleElement.innerText = "Hello, DOM!";

// This is a basic example, and there's much more you can do with the DOM.

// End of the code
