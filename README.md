Introduction
Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for writing efficient and scalable code. This repository aims to provide clear and concise JavaScript implementations of various data structures and algorithms, along with explanations of their usage and complexity analysis.

Data Structures
Arrays
JavaScript arrays are essential for storing and manipulating collections of data.

Linked Lists
Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next one.

Stacks
Stacks follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle and are often used for managing function calls, parsing expressions, and undo mechanisms.

Queues
Queues follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle and are useful for tasks such as task scheduling and managing resources.

Trees
Tree structures are hierarchical and include binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees.

Hash Tables
Hash tables provide efficient data retrieval by mapping keys to values using a hash function.

Heaps
Heaps are tree-based data structures used for implementing priority queues and efficient sorting algorithms.

Graphs
Graphs consist of nodes and edges and are used to model relationships between different entities.

Algorithms
Sorting
Various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort are implemented.

Searching
Searching algorithms include linear search, binary search, and depth-first search.

Recursion
Examples of recursive algorithms and their applications.

Dynamic Programming
Dynamic programming techniques for solving optimization problems.

Greedy Algorithms
Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.

Graph Algorithms
Graph traversal algorithms, shortest path algorithms, and depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) implementations.

Usage
Each data structure and algorithm is organized in its own directory with clear documentation and examples. Users can simply include the necessary files in their projects or explore the code for learning purposes.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or new data structures/algorithms to add, please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
